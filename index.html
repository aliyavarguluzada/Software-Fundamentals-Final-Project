    <p>Edward Witten (born August 26, 1951) is an American mathematical and theoretical physicist. 
        He is a Professor Emeritus in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. 
        Witten is a researcher in string theory, quantum gravity, supersymmetric quantum field theories, and other areas of mathematical physics. Witten's work has also significantly impacted pure mathematics. 
        In 1990, he became the first physicist to be awarded a Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union, for his mathematical insights in physics, such as his 1981 proof of the positive energy theorem in general relativity, and his interpretation of the Jones invariants of knots as Feynman integrals. 
        He is considered the practical founder of M-theory.</p>

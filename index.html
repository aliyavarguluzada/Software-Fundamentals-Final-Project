    <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
    <img src="/images/ss1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'),<br> 
        Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.[13] These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated massâ€“energy equivalence. 
        Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; 
        he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.[14][15] He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules.
        He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.</p>
